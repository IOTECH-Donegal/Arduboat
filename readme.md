# Boat and Submersible
Despite all the really good videos and notes on the Internet, I have yet to find a single, 
idiot's guide to building an **Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV)** or 
an **Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)**. 
This repo contains all notes and code for the Arduboat based ASV, the first step to an AUV.
Apart from being a central repo, this material is mostly public domain, 
please treat it as licensed to Creative Commons (CC BY 4.0).
If you copy or share the information, you must attribute it to its source (here!).
Any subsystem complete for alpha test will be marked so.
Anything else will be marked as **Work-in-Progress (WIP)** or **Not Started**.

A bill of material (BOM) will only be completed when an alpha vessel first sets sail.

In Ireland, we prefix Long Eireannach (LE) to the name of a boat, 
in the same way as the English use HMS and the USA uses (USS).

**LE Tupperware** is the REV 0.0 frame and no expense has been spared in its engineering.

## Subsystems
Go back to manufacturer's documentation in every case.
The notes below are mostly the "gotchas", those things that are not obvious until you start the build.
Don't touch anything until you have read extensively, one wrong connection will blow components. 

### 1. Cube Autopilot - WIP
[Information relating to the Autopilot](cube.md)


### 2. Control PC and Mission Planner - WIP


### 3. GNSS with heading and Inertial Navigation System (INS) - WIP 
[Information relating to the GNSS](GNSS.md)

### 4. Blue Robotics Components - WIP
[Information relating to the thrusters and ESCs](BR.md)


### 5. On board computer - WIP
A RPi 4B will be connected to the system eventually as an onboard computer.
Early research done.

### 6. LIDAR - Not Started

### 7. Cameras suited for photogrammetry - Not Started

### 8. Single Beam Echo Sounder (SBES) - Not Started

### 9. Side Scan (SS) - Not Started

### 10. Radio Remote Control (RC) - Not Started

### 11. Charging and Batteries - WIP
The alpha version will use a monstrous lead-acid leisure battery. 
Eventually, Li-ion parts and methods will be described here.
