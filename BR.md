# Blue Robotics Components - WIP

A basic kit has been purchased and assembled with a motor controller, all the instructions are included.
There is no independent PSU for 5VDC equipment, a power adapter needs to be separately purchased.

The power adapter cables also need to be ordered separately, these are XT90.

### Basic ESC v3
The ESCs are 30A, 7-26 volts, the Thruster Commander suggests 7-20V.
The prototype will use a 12VDC leisure battery, eventually changing to a 4S Lipo. 

The Thruster Commander comes with a single XT90 power connector. 
It would probably more convenient to have two power bricks, feeding dual power to the Cube.
The prototype currently has a single XT60 power brick and power to Cube Power 1 only.

The rest of the design will assume 24VDC power.
